# Socket Programming in Python and Java
<sub>Learning how to use similar API packages in different languages to develop a socket program. These socket programs depict two nodes on a network communicating with each other. Socket connections are established for multiple clients and a server to communicate through the TCP/IP protocol.  </sub>
